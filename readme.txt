== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If the "Godinterest Share" button doesn\'t get triggered on click (and your browser is redirected to a pinterest.com URL), please make sure that there is not extra code that is hijacking the click event (for example, a Google Analytics onclick event).  
A popular known plugin that does this is **Google Analytics for WordPress**. Try unchecking one or both of these options: 1) Track outbound clicks & downloads, 2) Check Advanced Settings, then make sure "Track outbound clicks as pageviews" is un-checked.  
Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.  
CSS styling and shortcode help available within the plugin admin.
